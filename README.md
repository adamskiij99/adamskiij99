### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying for my DPhil on the random systems CDT at the University of Oxford, joint with Imperial College London. My interests relevant to GitHub are stochastic analysis, financial maths, machine learning, and more recently, data science. You can find me at my [department homepage](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/adam.c.jones) where you can reach out.
